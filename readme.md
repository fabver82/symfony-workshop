# Introduction to Symfony framework

So you want to try Symfony ?! You have made the right choice !
Are you scared about it ? if yes ! Relax... The most difficult part is to set it up ! You will need a few package before starting. Make sure you have installed the following dependencies before attending the workshop.

## Prerequisites

- Docker - You should already have an intro about it. I will be using Docker Compose V2.
- [PHP 8 linux](https://linuxhint.com/install-php-8-ubuntu-22-04/) or [PHP 8 windows](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-install-php-8-on-windows)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) - It will be useful to quickly create symfony project with the terminal.

## check requirements

Now that you have installed all depedencies, let's check if you are ready to start a symfony project. If you had correcly installed Symfony CLI, you should be able to check the requirements with the following command :

```
symfony check:requirements
```

You should read a message with a green background saying : 'Your system is ready to run Symfony projects"

Congratulations !!!

If you need more informations about the installation, here is a link to the documentation : [https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html)
